# Simple Interest Calculator

Small web page built as a course exercise to practice basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The app lets the user:

- Enter an amount (principal)
- Choose an interest rate (slider)
- Select the number of years
- Compute the simple interest and see the result with the final year

This is not a production project, but a simple example of front-end logic and DOM manipulation in vanilla JavaScript.
